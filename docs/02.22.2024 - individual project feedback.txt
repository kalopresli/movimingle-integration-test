Colaborative movie choosing application
- Good project choice
- Think about the scalability
- Think about the data management
- More appealing to Qin

Car parts marketplace
- Also a good project, but less interesting idea

Project plan
- functional requirements
- non-functional requirements
- user stories

In the end I decided to go with the colaborative movie choosing application and have started working on the project plan.
